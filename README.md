# What is this?

This is a repository for the homeworks of the curricular unit Analysis of Biological Sequences of my Bioinformatics degree.

# 1st Homework

The first homework consisted in writing a small script to retrieve sequences that:

    Uses the Entrez API
    Allows the user to choose which database to query
    Allows the user to pass a search term
    Takes user input as command line arguments
    Uses the "history" API feature
    The result has to be in FASTA format and sent to STDOUT
    
# asbconverter

This is a converter. To know how to use the converter, check the README2.md in asbconverter folder.

# Assignment 1

In the first assignment of this curricular unit me and my group had to:
    Search the bibliography for a research paper that performs phylogenetic analyses;
    Understand the proposed biological problem;
    Obtain the sequences used in that research paper;
    Reproduce (or improve upon) the analyses therein performed;
    Interpret the obtained phylogenetic trees;
    Compare your results to those of the original paper;
    Make sure your analyses are reproducible;
    Write a report on what you did;
    
The paper choosed by us was the "Evolution of the mitochondrial genome in snakes: Gene
rearrangements and phylogenetic relationships" written by Jie Yan, Hongdan Li and Kaiya Zhou*
in 2008.

# Assignment 2

In this second assignment of this curricular unit me and my group had the main objective 
to solve a discussion that was being held by Botanists regarding
a certain plant population that had unique phenotypic traits, which they called "GreenLeaf".
This species, at first, had undistinguishable differences to another plant named “BlackLeaf”.
For this reason, some said it was a new species and others claimed to be the same in agreement
with the already said small differences being irrelevant to them. To overcome this argument,
they used many populations from the “BlackLeaf” species and two “GreenLeaf” individuals,
using RAD-Seq.
In order to solve this same problem, our team planned an approach. Considering the
learnt sequencing analysis techniques during our classes, we chose to apply High Throughput
Sequencing (HTS) methods.

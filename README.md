# What is this?

This is a repository for the homeworks of the curricular unit ASB (Análise de Sequências Biológicas) of my Bioinformatics degree.

# 1st Homework

The first homework consisted in writing a small script to retrieve sequences that:

    Uses the Entrez API
    Allows the user to choose which database to query
    Allows the user to pass a search term
    Takes user input as command line arguments
    Uses the "history" API feature
    The result has to be in FASTA format and sent to STDOUT
    
# asbconverter

This is a converter. To know how to use the converter, check the README2.md in asbconverter folder.

# Assignment 1

In the first assignment of this curricular unit me and my group had to:
    Search the bibliography for a research paper that performs phylogenetic analyses;
    Understand the proposed biological problem;
    Obtain the sequences used in that research paper;
    Reproduce (or improve upon) the analyses therein performed;
    Interpret the obtained phylogenetic trees;
    Compare your results to those of the original paper;
    Make sure your analyses are reproducible;
    Write a report on what you did;
    
The paper choosed by us was the "Evolution of the mitochondrial genome in snakes: Gene
rearrangements and phylogenetic relationships" written by Jie Yan, Hongdan Li and Kaiya Zhou*
in 2008.

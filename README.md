# 1st Homework

The first homework consisted in writing a small script to retrieve sequences that:

    Uses the Entrez API
    Allows the user to choose which database to query
    Allows the user to pass a search term
    Takes user input as command line arguments
    Uses the "history" API feature
    The result has to be in FASTA format and sent to STDOUT
